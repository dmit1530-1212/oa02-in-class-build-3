# In-class Build #3 - Toggle Navigation
This is a mentored build, thus follow the instructor's instructions/questions during the class block. You **MUST** be present in both classes to get a grade for this assignment. Being in attendance does not gaurantee you a grade for this assignment.

## Instructions
As this is a mentored build, you will be guided through the majority of the build. You will be prompted for suggestions, which may or may not work, and guided to a _correct_ solution for this build. You are also responsible for completing the build once your instructor has guided you to a point in the build where you can apply the concepts covered so far. This build may take more than 1 class to complete.

This is to be a **responsive design**.

## The Build Methodology
Start by writing all of your HTML. You will need a `<header>`, followed by a `<main>`. Inside of your `<header>`, you will need a first-level heading, your monkey logo, and a `<nav>` with three drop-down menus. These menus should be structured as follows: 

	> Products

	>> Featured

	>> Popgrips

	>> Accessories

	> Customize

	>> Create For You

	>> Create For Business

	> Sale

	>> See All 

For the remainder of the build, follow the recordings. As you work through this build, make sure to validate your HTML and to make commits whenever you reach a milestone in your work (i.e., after each web page is coded and when major sections of the CSS file are coded). 

## Submission Requirements
You must have at least **4 commits** (at least 2/day) of your build .

**You must be present in BOTH classes in order to receive a grade for this assessment. Builds that do not follow best naming practices, or do not validate, will receive a 0. Late submissions will not be accepted!**

**You must be present, and stay, in class in order to receive a grade for this assessment.**

**Commits to GitHub Classroom after the due date will NOT be graded!**

Zip up your file and submit it to Moodle (for a backup submission) and commit your project to GitHub Classroom.

> You should delete the **build-03-screenshots** folder in your local repository prior to your last commit. This folder is also **not** to be included in the ZIP file to Moodle.
